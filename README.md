## TASK 2 : Stock Market Prediction and Forecasting Using LSTM
### Dataset Information
Data given total trade quantity and turnover and we have to forecaste for next days what is the turnover in lacs.Features is given as Date , open , high , low , last and close . 
LSTM - Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are a type of recurrent neural network capable of learning order dependence in sequence prediction problems. This is a behavior required in complex problem domains like machine translation, speech recognition, and more. LSTMs are a complex area of deep learning.

### Steps Follow for solving this Problem 
1. We will collect the stock data
2. Preprocess the Data - Train and Test
3. Create an Stacked LSTM Model 
4. Predict the test data and plot the output
5. Predict the future 30 days and plot the output 
6. Cross Validation Using Randomseed
7. Data Preprocessing 
8. Analysis for next 30 days
