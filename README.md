## TASK 2 : Stock Market Prediction and Forecasting Using LSTM
### Dataset Information
Data given total trade quantity and turnover and we have to forecaste for next days what is the turnover in lacs.Features is given as Date , open , high , low , last and close . 
LSTM - Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are a type of recurrent neural network capable of learning order dependence in sequence prediction problems. This is a behavior required in complex problem domains like machine translation, speech recognition, and more. LSTMs are a complex area of deep learning.

## TASK 4 : Image to Pencil Sketch with Python

We need to read the image in RBG format and then convert it to a grayscale image. This will turn an image into a classic black and white photo. Then the next thing to do is invert the grayscale image also called negative image, this will be our inverted grayscale image. Inversion can be used to enhance details. Then we can finally create the pencil sketch by mixing the grayscale image with the inverted blurry image. This can be done by dividing the grayscale image by the inverted blurry image. Since images are just arrays, we can easily do this programmatically using the divide function from the cv2 library in Python.

## Steps follow for solving this problem :- 
1. Import the image
2. Read the image in RBG format
3. Convert it into grayscale image
4. Invert the image called negative image 
5. Finally create pencil sketch by mixing grayscale and negative image
